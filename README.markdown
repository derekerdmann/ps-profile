Powershell Profile
==================

Configuration files for Windows Powershell, including the fantastic [PsGet][1]
and [posh-git][2] modules.

To use, clone this repository to a `WindowsPowerShell` directory in the default
documents location.  Make sure script execution is allowed - if there's an
error, open an administrative prompt and run the following command:

    Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
